For the first time, Team 2337 is open-sourcing our competition code for Rebound Rumble, the 2012 FIRST FRC competition. Our robot was named the Admiral.

The code is still being changed, to accomodate other team projects and fix competition season issues.

Any comments and questions are welcome (preferably on Chief Delphi: http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=106664 )

For more information on the robot and performance: http://www.team2337.com/robots.html

The robot CAD can be found on FRC-Designs: http://www.frc-designs.com/html/CAD_2012.html

GitHub handles LabVIEW files as strictly binary files, so to actually view the code, one must download this whole repo and view it on a local installation of LabVIEW 2012.

A quick robot overview:
-----------

* A 4CIM, 8WD dual-speed drivetrain using pneumatic tires designed to minimize chain use
* Two KOP-wheel shooter, fixed hood, no turret. Powered by two Banebot 550s through a Cimulator gearbox.
* A 33 and 148-inspired 'dingus' - large pneumatic cylinder - used successfully for triple and co-op balances
* Bridge manipulator and external intake with CD7-related design, pneumatically powered, with throttle motors to direct the ball side to side
* Intake and ball containment system designed to hold just three balls, powered by two AndyMarks and a Fisher Price


A code overview
-----------

* An **autonomous that reads scripts** (with its own language) placed via FTP on the cRIO.

	* There is an overarching structure that manages commands based on their parameters outlined in the script
	
	* Possible autonomous functions reference already written code in Periodic Tasks.vi
	
	* An autonomous script is selected by the driver controller while the robot is disabled
	
* All logic is contained inside the **Periodic Tasks.vi**, with control data passed to Periodic Tasks via local variables

	* This means all code is consistently executed (no depending on DS packets affecting how fast commands are updated)
	
	* Teleop.vi is used to assign joystick commands into robot commands, each with its own local variable
	
	* Autonomous scripts reference these robot commands
	
* **Simple shooter speed control**

	* A proximity sensor is mounted to detect one rising edge per revolution of the shooter wheel, managed by the WPI Counter class
	
	* A well-tuned PI loop to actually manage speed control, with quick ramping up to speed and precision of +/- 5 RPM at normal key shooting speeds
	
* A **basic vision** program mostly copied from the Rectangular Target Processing example

	* 'Auto-targeting' program moves wheels to line up robot with target
	
	* Auto-targeting is still not well-tuned, not very functional
	
	* A very low camera exposure is used to limit the amount of possible colors interfering with the mask
	
* **'Cheesy drive'** - a form of arcade drive - provided by FRC 33 (which was based on work done by FRC 254)

	* First year of non-mechanum, non-Lunacy wheel drive for 2337
	
	* Custom ramping on the joystick input to reduce quick, potentially hazardous movements
	
* An **intake logic** system used to suck balls in one at a time, and queue balls out one at a time

	* Three eye sensors indicate whether balls are in their appropriate positions

As an offseason project, the 'brogrammming' team is also working on a Java port of our code. When finished, it will also be open-sourced.
