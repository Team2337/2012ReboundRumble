A quick guide to the scripts for Team 2337's automonous:

# = comment
First line is quick description of the script, displayed under User Messages in the DS for drivers pre-match

All of the different script 'functions':

basicDrive(relative, start type, start param, end type, end param, driveSpeed, [label])
manualDrive(relative, start type, start param, end type, end param, leftDriveSpeed, rightDriveSpeed, [label])
intake(relative, start type, start param, end type, end param, [label])
shoot(relative, start type, start param, end type, end param, [label])
setShooterRPM(relative, start type, start param, speed, [label (not recommended)])
testFunct(relative, start type, start param, end type, end param, [label])
setGear(relative, start type, start param, "low"/"high")

Relative, I believe, was never implemented in the code. I believe it was intended to be able to chain functions together.
